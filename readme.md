# Sparrow Lending
[Sparrow Lending] (https://www.sparrowfi.com/) is a unique peer-to-peer Palo-Alto based lending company that seeks to help college students acquire loans and bypass general institutions like banks and private companies. Through the use of novel machine learning algorithms, Sparrow can set interest rates at a low enough rate to 1) compensate the alumni who loaned money to Sparrow's fund and 2) allow the student to have a very manageable amount of interest to pay off on the loan.

# Our Model -- Sparrow Anghiari
To predict the optimal interest rate, we first had to predict the expected recovery rate and probability of default. Since Sparrow Anghiari is a non-traditional model, we based the probability of default on a combination of factors including a student's major, college, and test scores. We also used LendingClub data from 2004 - 2017 to train the model. The models we trained were a gradient boosted random forest and neural net, which we optimized using hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch), dropout, and cross-validation. Once we achieved high enough accuracies, we deployed the models onto Google Cloud Platform, which we could then routinely call in the Sparrow Lending iOS app using a severless function. Finally, to actually see the app in action and get the user's banking and previous credit information, we used an API called Plaid, whose data we fed into the model to get an interest rate prediction.
